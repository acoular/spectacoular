SpectAcoular! An extension for Acoular
======================================

**SpectAcoular** builds upon the capabilities of `Acoular`_ by providing interactive controls (widgets) for creating custom graphical user interfaces using the `Bokeh`_ visualization library.

`Bokeh`_ leverages modern web browsers for rendering and event handling via a high-level JavaScript framework. This enables real-time, platform-independent applications, and facilitates the development of client-server architectures for distributed processing of microphone array data.


A few highlights of the framework:

   * Operating system independence
   * Tools for microphone array data acquisition, analysis and exploration
   * Custom interactive client-server applications
   * Expandable interface to support flexible software design with custom processing

We welcome your feedback, suggestions, or reports of success using SpectAcoular via the `Acoular Discussions Forum`_.

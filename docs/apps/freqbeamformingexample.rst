Frequency Domain Beamforming App
================================

This application can be used to calculate source maps from measured microphone array data with different frequency domain methods. The data was collected during a wind tunnel experiment on trailing edge noise.

Serving the Application:
------------------------

One can run the application by simply running 

.. code-block:: console

    $ result_explorer --show

in the command line or by navigating to the `spectacoular/apps` folder and typing the following command in a dedicated console (e.g. shell)

.. code-block:: console

    $ bokeh serve --show FreqBeamformingExample


Serving this application produces the following interactive interface in your browser:

   
.. figure:: freqbeamformingexample.mp4
    :align: center
    :width: 100%
    :figwidth: 100%

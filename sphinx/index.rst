SpectAcoular! An extension for Acoular
======================================

SpectAcoular is built on top of `Acoular <http://www.acoular.org/>`_ and offers additional modules to further simplify the handling of Acoular. It implements interactive controls (widgets) for building individual graphical user interfaces with the visualization library Bokeh. Bokeh uses web browsers for visualization, whereby rendering and event handling is performed by a high-level JavaScript library. This allows to
create real-time applications and to use the capabilities of Acoular independently from the operating system. In addition, building client-server applications is supported,
which makes it possible to interactively control microphone array data processing in a distributed scenario.
 

A few highlights of the framework:

    * independent from operating system
    * tools for microphone array data acquisition, analysis and exploration
    * individual client-server applications with interactive visualization
    * Easily expandable interface to meet the requirements of flexible software design with custom processing

Problems, suggestions and success using Spectacoular may be reported via the `acoular-users  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/acoular-users>`_ discussion forum or to *info (at) acoular.org*.
